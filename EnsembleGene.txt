To obtain the cDNA sequence corresponding to your protein of interest, you can use UniProt's Retrieve/ID mapping tool. Here are the steps you can follow:

Go to the UniProt website (https://www.uniprot.org/) and click on "Retrieve/ID mapping" under the "Tools" section.

In the "Retrieve/ID mapping" page, enter your list of protein identifiers in the "Your list" box. You can enter the IDs one per line or separated by commas.

In the "Select an identifier type" box, choose the type of ID that matches your input list. For example, if your IDs are UniProt accession numbers, select "UniProtKB AC/ID" from the dropdown menu.

In the "Select a database" box, choose "Ensembl Genomes" from the dropdown menu.

Click on "Map" to retrieve the Ensembl Gene IDs corresponding to your protein IDs.

Once you have the Ensembl Gene IDs, you can use them to search for the corresponding cDNA sequences in your list of fasta files. You can write a Python script to automate this task, using the Ensembl Gene ID as a key to match the protein ID to the appropriate fasta file.

Here's an example Python script that uses Biopython to parse the fasta files and extract the cDNA sequences:

python
Copy code
from Bio import SeqIO

# Load the list of Ensembl Gene IDs
with open('ensembl_gene_ids.txt') as f:
    ensembl_ids = [line.strip() for line in f]

# Load the fasta files
fasta_files = ['drosophila1.fasta', 'drosophila2.fasta', ...]
fasta_records = SeqIO.index_db('drosophila.fasta.idx', fasta_files, 'fasta')

# Loop over the Ensembl Gene IDs and extract the cDNA sequences
for ensembl_id in ensembl_ids:
    if ensembl_id in fasta_records:
        cDNA_seq = fasta_records[ensembl_id].seq.transcribe()
        print('>{}'.format(ensembl_id))
        print(cDNA_seq)
        
In this example, the list of Ensembl Gene IDs is stored in a text file called "ensembl_gene_ids.txt". The fasta files are loaded using Biopython's SeqIO.index_db function, which creates an index of the fasta files to allow for fast retrieval of sequences by ID. The cDNA sequences are extracted using Biopython's transcribe method, which transcribes the DNA sequence to RNA and removes any introns. The output is in fasta format, with the Ensembl Gene ID as the header and the cDNA sequence as the sequence.
