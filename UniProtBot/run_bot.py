    # or get from previous work -> list of species that have been fasta filed

    # get the fasta files of the proteomes or load it


    # Options now to do:
    # - use fLPS2.0 program to annotate the fasta files
    #   - Perform Annotate: from annotated files, annotate the fasta files
    #   - Perform CountAnnotations: from annotated files, count the number of most common seq_names, signatures, and residue counts and biases
    #   - Perform Visualize: Visualize the results of CountAnnotations with graphs and save it as png
